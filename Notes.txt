    - Have multiple programs, each which utilizes a different algorithm.
        - starting condition = random, center, MAXINDEX
        - size of search area for maxindex = 1,2,3,4,5 tiles. (eww @ 5)
        - ordered index queue in recursion.
    - utilize basic ML to predict which algorithm is best based on the circumstances.
        - predictors:
            - Average Value (Density)
            - City size
            - Success / Fail (output variable)
            - Solution time (recursive calls) (output variable)
            - number of districts
        - Response:
            - which model was best (lowest solution time) for the given input.
    - Can I make prolog write to a file
    - Can I make prolog read from a file?
        - would make test cases easier
    - Can I make prolog use random numbers?
